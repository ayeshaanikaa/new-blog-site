                <section><h3>1. Find Your Destination</h3>
                    <p>The first thing you will need to decide upon, when planning your trip, is what destination do you want to visit? A European tour where it's hot with lots of culture, or maybe a cooler climate where you may be on the hunt for your heritage, like on a Scottish tour, either sounds like lots of fun to us.

                    <h3>2. Decide The Length of Your Trip</h3>
                    <p>You have the location secured, your next step is to plan how long your trip is going to be. If you’re solo travelling, you may be lucky to have an extended period of time to explore all of the hidden paths your destination has to offer. For those with a shorter time frame, there’s still plenty a destination can offer, you just need to know how to plan your time to fit everything in. With our selection of UK and Ireland tours, we have a length of stay to suit all travellers. This flexibility means you can tour England for a weekend, followed by a week-long trip around Spain and Portugal, seeing a multitude of cultures along the way.</p>

                    <h3>3. Book Flights & Travel Accommodations</h3>
                    <p>Destination, check. Length of stay decided, check. Let's start thinking about how you're going to get to your chosen location and your travel accommodation. Flights, ferries, car, bus, or taxi, travelling has never been an easier commute. Depending on where your starting point is, more often than not, a flight may be the first logical step when planning your trip.
                    </p>
                    <p>With many sources telling you tips and tricks to booking a cheap flight, such as “only book on a Tuesday in a private browser mode”, “look to book exactly 60 days before the day you want to fly” etc, it can be conflicting in what they suggest. Our advice is to be prepared. From our experience, the cost of flights only increases as we get close to our chosen date of flying. With that in mind, we have several guides to help if looking for direct flights from the US: <ul>

                    <h3>4. Get Inspired by Local Activities & Attractions</h3>
                    <p>Now you have planned the foundations of your trip, you can begin to get excited at all the attractions and local activities you may get to experience. After all, there must have been something that caught your eye for you to want to visit your chosen destination in the first place?</p>

                    <h3>5. Packing Your Bags</h3>
                    <p>Who said planning a trip was hard? With your destination chosen, the length of stay secured, flights booked, travel accommodation thought about, and being inspired by local activities, all that's left to do is pack.

                        When packing, the key thing to remember is your weight allowance when flying. Most domestic airlines are quite generous with a 22 kg - 25 kg allowance, but you will have to check with your airline when booking. Its very easy to overpack, but from our time travelling the most important items to take, which may get overlooked, are:</p>
